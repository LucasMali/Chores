#Chores

This project was a student project and was done very quickly. There are a few aspects that still need to be implemented, based on my opinion.
In some of the loading api XML loops, there should be use of either basic or complex concurency.

Note:
This application requires a API to interact with or it will not work. Any API server will work as long as it returns with the correct XML formatting.
